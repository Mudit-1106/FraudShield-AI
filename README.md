# FraudShield AI – Kavach Nexus 🔐

FraudShield AI is a smart, behavior-driven digital payment fraud detection system built under **Project Kavach Nexus**.  
It detects suspicious transactions in real time using rule-based intelligence and machine learning–ready architecture.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time fraud detection (Low / Medium / High risk)
- Explainable AI decisions (why a transaction is flagged)
- User & Admin role-based dashboard
- Fraud alerts with review & block actions
- Fraud analytics using interactive charts
- Firebase-backed transaction & user data
- ML backend integration support (FastAPI)

## 🧠 How It Works (Simple)
1. User performs a transaction  
2. Context data is captured (amount, location, behavior, time, device)
3. Rule checks are applied instantly
4. Risk score is calculated
5. Transaction is approved, warned, or blocked
6. Decision reasons are shown clearly to the user/admin
